Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. By default, a value of 1 is used. Example: when this is set to 30%, the new RC can be scaled up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old and new pods do not exceed 130% of desired pods.

Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0. By default, a fixed value of 1 is used. Example: when this is set to 30%, the old RC can be scaled down to 70% of desired pods immediately when the rolling update starts.
